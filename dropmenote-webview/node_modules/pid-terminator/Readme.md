# pid-terminator

Every so often, I get the following error: `Error: listen EADDRINUSE 127.0.0.1:3000`.
This module allows to terminate a process(pid) associated with a localhost/port that
is still running in the background even though the application was closed.For now, Mac only.

## installation

#### global

```bash
npm install pid-terminator -g
```

#### local

```bash
npm install pid-terminator --save-dev
```

## usage

you can terminate one or more processes:

```bash
$ pid-terminator PORT_Nº [PORT_Nº[...]]
```

you can also call it from a `npm script` in you `package.json`. Before
running the node application, `pid-terminator` will  verify if a process
associated with `localhost:4000` is already running and terminate it if it does.


```json
{
  "name": "my-project",
  "version": "1.0.0",
    "scripts": {
      "start": "./node_modules/pid-terminator/build/bin/index.js 4000 && node server.js"
    }
}
```
