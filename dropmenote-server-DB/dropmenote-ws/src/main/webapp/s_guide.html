            DropMeNote allows people to connect and converse using DMN Codes. Create your own DMN Codes, print them out and let people find your business in a unique way. Whether you buy printed DMN Codes or generate them yourself, the DMN Code will include all relevant information, including name, chat icon, description, your alias for communication and even include photos should they be needed. The amount of DMN Codes is not limited and all of them can be managed after creation by you or others that you designate through an administration system.

            In case you have pre-generated DMN Codes already printed out, pick the one that you want to register your item or service under and let the application read the DMN Code. After filling in the required fields, your registration should now be complete.

            Stick the label visibly on your chosen item (e.g. driverâ€™s car window, the front side of a letterbox, luggage tag, etc.). For the semi-transparent reverse labels that are meant to be applied on glass, place them on the proper place first and then do the registration process.

            The best part is that your customers or clients don't even need to have the app installed to contact you, any basic DMN Code reader will do just fine. After someone scans the DMN Code, they will be directed to the relevant content via a web browser and can begin talking to you immediately. All communication is encrypted and safely processed through a secure token included in the DMN Code itself.
