The extraordinary measures taken to transport Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky 
from Ukraine to the US capital are a sign of just how crucial the two countries' relationship is for both sides.
After visiting the front line in eastern Ukraine on Tuesday, Mr Zelensky's journey 
to Washington DC began with an overnight train journey to Poland before boarding a 
US Air Force plane, reportedly supported by a Nato spy-plane and an F-15 fighter jet.
Reports of the visit to Washington began circulating early this week, but it wasn't 
confirmed until early on Wednesday morning, when US officials felt certain that Ukraine's 
leader was safely en route to the US capital.
The visit had been discussed for months but the final preparations were made quickly - 
the two presidents spoke about it on 11 December and an invitation was extended to 
Mr Zelensky three days later. Only once the visit had been confirmed could final plans 
be put into action.
Unsurprisingly, no official information about the journey was released - 
security is tight around presidential visits even during peacetime, 
but for a wartime leader the risks are greater still.
With the threat of Russian missiles making air travel over Ukraine too risky,
 Mr Zelensky appears to have taken a secretive train ride through Ukraine to Poland, 
 where he was spotted early on Wednesday at a railway station in the border town of Przemysl.
Pictures from Polish TV showed an entourage including Mr Zelensky walking 
along a platform with a blue-yellow Ukrainian train in the background. 
The group then got into a convoy of waiting cars, including black Chevrolet Suburbans - 
a favourite model of the US government.
Many Western leaders and officials have travelled by train to visit Mr Zelensky in Kyiv, 
but this was his first time abroad since Russia's war began.
